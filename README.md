- Using Python, JavaScript, and the OpenAI API making this a summary generator for notes that the user takes.

## Description

- My motivation for building this project is to create a note taking app that will generate a summary for the note content.
- This project was built to provide users with a summarizing generator for their notes.
- This solves the problem of needing notes to be summarized after taking a lot of notes.
- In this project, I learned the importance of storing notes locally so that runtime is decreased because of notes not rendering in each time a user logs into their profile.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

Here is a table of contents to make it easy for users to locate which section they need.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM bcrypt, NPM connect-session-sequelize, NPM dayjs, NPM express-handlebars, NPM express-session, NPM dotenv, NPM pg, NPM sequelize, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, LangChain, OpenAI, and Nodemon. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode (IDE). Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, establish the database using postgreSQL, and then run the server using NPM run dev. Once you've done this the website will be deployed locally for testing, debugging, and developing.
